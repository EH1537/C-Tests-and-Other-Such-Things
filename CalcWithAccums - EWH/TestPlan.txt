Like the car assignment, this one was 75% planning, then execution.
I had a hand-written sheet with my naming scheme and all the calculations out
I wrote out the code for the calculations first and made sure they lined up with some hand work I did
I did the mulch first, and ensured that worked by comparing it to hand work, then I did the truck bed stuff
After that it was a matter of coding and testing the color for the box.
Even though it wasn’t part of the assignment, I felt it was appropriate to do the validations, which took some time. 
Since I couldn’t get out of debugging mode to save my life for at least 30 minutes. 
Testing the validation was as easy as leaving the appropriate box blank and making sure the correct error came up.
